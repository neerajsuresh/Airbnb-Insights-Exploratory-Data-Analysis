# Airbnb-Insights-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
WIn this project, we delve into the Airbnb dataset for New York City, containing 48,895 rows and 16 columns. This dataset provides valuable information about hosts, areas, room types, prices, and more, allowing us to gain insights into the world of travel and hospitality.

Business Problem
Our analysis aims to address several key questions:

Hosts and Areas Insights: We explore the dataset to uncover insightful information about hosts and different areas in NYC. This includes understanding host behaviors, preferences, and the dynamics of various neighborhoods.

Room Type and Pricing: We investigate the relationship between room types and their prices across different areas. By analyzing these patterns, we can offer insights into pricing strategies and customer preferences.

Busiest Hosts: We identify the busiest hosts based on their rental activity. This helps us understand the trends and popularity of different hosts in the Airbnb ecosystem.

Correlation between Variables: We examine the correlation between different variables in the dataset. By identifying correlations, we can reveal hidden patterns and relationships that impact the Airbnb market.

High-Priced Hosts: We pinpoint hosts that charge higher prices for their listings. This analysis can offer valuable insights into premium offerings and what sets them apart.

Total Room Count by Room Type: We calculate the total room count for each room type in NYC based on the listings. This provides an overview of the distribution of room types in the city.
